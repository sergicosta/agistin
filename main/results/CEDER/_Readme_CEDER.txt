Case 1 (C1):

	- No sizing or existing battery is considered.
	- Considered a 4 pumps in a bank.
	- 2 Banks of pump for pipe 1 and pipe 2. Constraint is added in order to prevent Bank1 and Bank2 to work in the same time.
	- Turbine of 40 kW.
	- Use of a VarSource to connect the R1 and R2.
	- No sizing of PV is considered. Only 16 kW already installed.
	- All data is obtained from the CEDER database for 24h of the day 2023/07/02 (summer) and 2023/01/25 (Winter).
	- Summer and Winter study.

Case 2 (C2):

	- Able to size a maximum of 66 kW of PV in total, while 16kW are already installed (56 kW new).	
	-  Able to size from 0 20kW and 20kWh of battery
	-  2 Simulation for winter (2023/01/25) and summer (2023/07/02)


Case 3 (C3):
	- Able to size a maximum of 66 kW of PV in total, while 16kW are already installed (56 kW new). 
	- Considering the 90 kW and (??) kWh of battery already installed in the system.
	- 2 simulations for winter (2023/01/25) and summer (2023/07/02)



Case 4 (C4):
	- Single simulation of the system in winter and summer for better PV and battery sizing.
	- 48h
	- Typical summer and winter day, as the result of the mean
